<span class="section">NAME</span>
       edit - simple text editor

<span class="section">SYNOPSIS</span>
       <b>edit</b> <i>file</i>

<span class="section">DESCRIPTION</span>
       <i>edit</i> is a modal, terminal-based text editor. It aims to provide a
       simple yet powerful editing model, in a suckless-style codebase.

       <i>edit</i> uses a selection-centric, selection-then-action model inspired by
       kakoune, where a selection is a set of contiguous characters on a given
       line.  Indeed, most commands act on a list of selections: on saved
       selections if any, otherwise on running selections.

       By default, the running selections list contains only the cursor,
       making the selection abstraction invisible for simple editing. It is
       also possible to drop an anchor below the cursor, making running
       selections contain all characters between the anchor and the cursor.
       For more elaborate editing, such as multi-cursor or column editing,
       there are several ways to save selections.

<span class="section">OPTIONS</span>
       <b>-v</b>     prints version information to stderr, then exits.

<span class="section">USAGE</span>
       The default mode is the normal mode, in which most keys are associated
       to an edition command.

       For some commands, it makes sense to execute them multiple times. Enter
       a multiplier <i>m</i> before these commands to get the expected result. If no
       multiplier is specified, the default value of 1 is assumed.

   <b>Editor interaction</b>
       <b>?</b>      display an help message

       <b>q/Q</b>    quit/force quit

       <b>s</b>      change a run-time setting (see subsection "Run-time settings")

       <b>e/E</b>    execute make/a shell command and get back to <i>edit</i>

   <b>File management</b>
       <b>w/W</b>    write/write as

       <b>R</b>      reload

   <b>Entering insert mode</b>
       <b>i</b>      enter insert mode (see subsection "Insert mode")

       It is also possible to enter insert mode at a specific location.
       However, these commands do not combine well when applied to one than
       one selection, therefore they empty the saved selections list and
       unanchor the anchor before entering insert mode.

       <b>I/A</b>    at the start/end of the cursor line

       <b>o/O</b>    on an empty line created below/above the cursor line

   <b>Navigation</b>
       <b>l/h, Right/Left</b>
              move to <i>m</i> -th next/previous character

       <b>j/k, Down/Up</b>
              move to <i>m</i> -th next/previous line

       <b>g/G</b>    move to <i>m</i> -th/last line of the file

       <b>m</b>      move to matching bracket

       <b>0/^/$</b>  move to start/first non-blank character/end of line

       <b>t/T</b>    move to <i>m</i> -th next/previous word

       <b>}/{</b>    move to <i>m</i> -th next/previous block

       <b>n/N</b>    move to <i>m</i> -th next/previous selection

       <b>J</b>      jump to <i>m</i> -th next match for prompted pattern (useful to navigate
              quickly through the file without changing selections)

   <b>Selections management</b>
       <b>Escape</b> forget saved selections, unanchor, reset multiplier

       <b>c</b>      display number of saved selections

       <b>v</b>      anchor/unanchor

       <b>a</b>      add running selections to saved selections, unanchor

       <b>z</b>      duplicate the running selection on the next <i>m</i> lines (designed
              for easy block/column editing)

       <b>./%/b</b>  select cursor line/all lines/ <i>m</i> blocks

       <b>:</b>      select custom range of lines

       Custom ranges must be formatted <i>min,max</i> where <i>min</i> / <i>max</i> is either empty
       (meaning 1/last line number), a dot (meaning cursor line number) or an
       integer.

       <b>f, /</b>   search for pattern (see subsection "Search pattern syntax")

       <b>*</b>      search for the word that is currently under the cursor

       Searching will create a new saved selections list containing all
       substrings of previously saved selections matching the given pattern.

   <b>Edition commands</b>
       <b>u/U</b>    switch to lowercase/uppercase

       <b>K</b>      comment/uncomment line

       <b>>/<, Tab/Shift-Tab</b>
              <i>m</i> increase/decrease line indent

       <b>x, Delete/Backspace</b>
              suppress selection content if any, else <i>m</i> characters
              after/before

       <b>r</b>      replace (see subsection "Replace pattern syntax")

       <b>Control-A</b>
              autocomplete with longest common prefix

   <b>Lines management</b>
       <i>edit</i> has a line-centric clipboard. The following commands do not act on
       selections but directly on lines.

       <b>y/Y</b>    yank <i>m</i> lines/blocks, starting at cursor

       <b>d/D</b>    delete <i>m</i> lines/blocks, starting at cursor

       <b>p/P</b>    paste after/before cursor line <i>m</i> times

       <b>Shift-Down/Shift-Up</b>
              move lines of running selections <i>m</i> lines down/up

   <b>Insert mode</b>
       In insert mode, most keys insert their character before the selections.

       <b>Right, Left, Down, Up, Delete, Backspace, Control-A, Shift-Down
       Shift-Up</b>
              like in normal mode

       <b>Escape</b> get back to normal mode

   <b>Dialog mode</b>
       When the editor need additionnal user input, it switches to dialog
       mode. In this mode, the user is prompted something on the bottom line
       of the screen.

       <b>Left, Right, Control-A, Control-E</b>
              navigate the input

       <b>Up</b>     recover the last input associated with the prompt

       <b>Down</b>   clear the input

       <b>Delete/Backspace</b>
              suppress character after/before the cursor

       <b>Enter</b>  validate input, get back to normal mode

       <b>Escape</b> cancel, get back to normal mode

   <b>Run-time settings</b>
       Setting assignements must be formatted <i>name=value</i> where <i>name</i> is in the
       following list and <i>value</i> of the according type. Any integer value is
       considered a boolean, 0 meaning FALSE and any other value meaning TRUE.

       <b>c</b>      case sensitive (boolean, default: TRUE)

       <b>fs</b>     field separator (character, default: ',')

       <b>h</b>      highlight selections (boolean, default: TRUE)

       <b>l</b>      language extension (string, default: deduced from filename)

       <b>sh</b>     syntax highlight (boolean, default: TRUE)

       <b>tw</b>     tab width (integer, default: 4)

<span class="section">NOTES</span>
   <b>Search and replace engine</b>
       The search and replace engine is home-grown. While it has some caveats
       (see section "ISSUES"), it is quite capable: the search is incremental
       and supports regular expressions, and the replace supports the reuse of
       subpatterns and fields from the to-be-replaced string.

       Using the engine should feel pretty straightforward as it can be used
       in a typical sed fashion:

       <b>(1)</b>    Choose a line range with <b>%</b> or <b>b</b> or <b>:</b> or <b>.</b>

       <b>(2)</b>    Specify a search pattern with <b>f</b> or <b>/</b>

       <b>(3)</b>    Specify a replace pattern with <b>r</b>

       But there is more to it than a sed imitation. Using a home-grown engine
       allows for better integration with the editor. Indeed, as all these
       steps make sense individually, one can use any combination of these.

       Syntaxes are described in a Backus-Naur form notation in subsections
       "Search pattern syntax" and "Replace pattern syntax".

   <b>Syntax highlighting system</b>
       Designing a syntax highlighting system capable enough to perform
       exhaustive, semantically correct syntax highlighting for many languages
       is very challenging. In the context of a tiny, autonomous codebase,
       this goal is soon forgotten.

       <i>edit</i> syntax highlighting system try to balance capability and
       simplicity. Its semantic understanding is limited, and is designed to
       process lines individually. Its simplicity makes it really easy to add
       language support, and easy to compute at runtime.

       It works well for keywords, numbers, monoline strings/comments, and
       markup languages where a line break is significant (Markdown or Gemtext
       for example); but not so much for multilines strings/comments or some
       other markup languages (XML for example).

       The commenting command use single line comments: the user is encouraged
       to use it over ranges of lines instead of using multiline comments.

   <b>Encoding</b>
       <i>edit</i> only works with UTF-8 encoded text.

   <b>Tabulations</b>
       <i>edit</i> is designed to work with spaces, not tabs. When opening a file,
       tabs are converted to spaces (according to the <b>TAB_WIDTH</b> value).

       Unfortunately, some languages recquire tabs (makefiles are an example).
       To accomodate these, the language-level <b>CONVERT_LEADING_SPACES</b> flag can
       be set so that leading spaces are converted back to tabs when saving.

   <b>Trailing spaces</b>
       By default, the <b>SUPPRESS_TRAILING_SPACES</b> option is set, which has the
       effect of ignoring trailing spaces when saving.

   <b>Multiples selections on a given line</b>
       Selections can not overlap.

       Indenting and commenting is performed at most once per line, no matter
       how much selections a line contains.

   <b>Undo/redo</b>
       There is no undo/redo mechanism. Instead, the user is advised to save
       frequently and reload the file when a set of actions is to be reverted.

   <b>Arbitrary yanking</b>
       It is not possible to yank only a part of a given line. The clipboard
       is designed to work with ranges of lines, not arbitrary text sequences.

   <b>Lines wrapping</b>
       It is not possible to wrap lines.

<span class="section">CUSTOMIZATION</span>
       <i>edit</i> is customized by creating a custom <i>config.h</i> and (re)compiling the
       source code. This keeps it fast, secure and simple.

   <b>Languages support</b>
       Supported languages are defined in <i>languages.h</i> with two <b>#ifdef</b> <i>LANGUAGE</i>
       enclosed parts (one for language declaration, one for inclusion in the
       <b>languages</b> array). Mimicking other languages is advised when adding
       support for a new anguage.

<span class="section">ISSUES</span>
   <b>Repeaters in regular expressions</b>
       Repeaters always match as much as possible, potentially eating too much
       characters and invalidating a valid match.

       For example, ".*." never matches anything because the leading ".*" eats
       all the selection, leaving no more characters to be matched by the
       trailing ".".
